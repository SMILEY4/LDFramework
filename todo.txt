   
- render tilemap

- entity system

- connect renderer to entity system
- connect maplayers to entity system


- tmx: support more tileLayer formats (not only cvs)

- add InputSystem (unique for each scene -> switch control-scheme)


- sceneSystem:
	master scene:
		-> always active -> draws after active scene -> effects/logic not bound to specific scene (e.g transitions)
	
	scene layers:
		-> sceneManager:layer:activeScene
							 :scenes
							 :masterScene
							 
		-> differend layers of sceneSystems (replace current manager with layer -> new manager handles layers)
			(e.g: layer0=gameworld, layer1=worldOverlay(), layer2=gui
